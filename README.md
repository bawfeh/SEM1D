# SEM1D
Python code for **spectral element method** for 1D PDEs describing fluid flow problems.

Files Attached here were used to solve:
 1. 1D **scalar hyperbolic conservations laws** using a class of semi-Lagrangian RKDG time-stepping schemes
 2. 1D **convection-diffusion problems** using a class of semi-Lagrangian RK exponential integrators
